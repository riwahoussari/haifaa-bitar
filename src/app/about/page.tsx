"Understanding oneself and one's own story is the most powerful tool a human can have". 


-- ABOUT ME
As a clinical psychologist, psychotherapist, and psychoanalyst, I work within the psychoanalytical approach, which allows access to your unconscious mind, which allows you to explore and understand yourself better.

Working within the field of clinical psychology since 2013, l have developed my expertise in treating trauma, depression, anxiety, and OCD by helping patients, of all age groups, develop insight into their condition and their life experiences to allow for further growth.

My goal is to offer you the space to explore and analyze yourself from an analytical perspective, to be able to grow beyond your challenges, take charge of your own life, and to achieve your own goals.
